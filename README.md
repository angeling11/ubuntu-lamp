# Simple LAMP Vagrant box

Simple LAMP environment inside Vagrant box. Based on official `ubuntu/xenial64` box.

## In the box:

- Ubuntu 18.04
- Apache 2.4
- MySQL 5.7
- PHP 7.3
- Node.js 12.x (with NPM)

### Additionally installed:

- phpMyAdmin
- Git
- Composer
- Yarn

## How to set up:

Assuming that VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/) and Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/) are already installed on your computer.

1. Clone or download + unzip repository 
2. In your terminal go to the directory and type `vagrant up`
3. Wait
4. Enjoy

## How to use:

After setup is finished, go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. You should see the `phpinfo()` page.
`./` is your "DocumentRoot". I recommend to keep your projects in the `projects/` folder. And make symlinks from `/` to `public_html` folder of your project. But itâ€™s up to you.

`phpMyAdmin` is accessible at http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin/ Username is 'root', password - 'toor'
